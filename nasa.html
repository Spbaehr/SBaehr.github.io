                              This project was a competition team that participated in NASA's Micro-G-Next Challenge to create an autonomous boat for emergency rescue on Earth. Our team, UC Berkeley Water Bears, placed within the top 8 colleges in the US.

                              My main contribution to the team was leading the design and manufacturing of the boat hull. Initially, a rough geometry was created in CAD, and simulations using ANSYS were performed to find the center of buoyancy for stability, and stress and strain concentrations when dropped from a 15ft height (as specified by the challenge requirements to iterate on the geometry. Once a geometry was finalized, negative molds of the top and bottom hulls were made in Fusion360, and were manufactured on a 3-axis CNC out of a block of MDF using the CAM software in Fusion360.

                              Once the negative molds were made, 3 layers of carbon fiber and epoxy were placed on each mold using hand lay-ups, and then vacuum bagged overnight to cure. Once cured the carbon fiber composite was removed from the mold, and the excess materials were removed. Lastly, some sanding and final epoxy patchwork was done to produce the final hull.

                              On top of leading manufacturing, I also aided in the testing phase of the vehicle. This included running a series of increasingly challenging situations in order to test the robustness of our autonomous driving software. With each new test, small calibrations were made until the performance target of reaching the desired location within a couple of feet was met.
