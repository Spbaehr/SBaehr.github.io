                                 “In the van, we can see the rocket in the distance, lit up and shining, an obelisk. In reality, of course, it’s a 4.5-megaton bomb loaded with explosive fuel, which is why everyone else is driving away from it.” - Chris Hadfield

                                 I am a current 4th year student at UC Berkeley pursuing a BS in Mechanical Engineering w/ a concentration in Aerospace. I have an immense passion for space fueled by interest in the unkown, and by my drive for conquering new challenges. This led me to join UC Berkeley's liquid bi-propellant rocketry team Space Enterprise at Berkeley (SEB) my sophomore year. 
                                 The major goal of the team to become the first collegiate team to successfully launch a liquid bi-propellant to the Kármán line. In the path to this goal, we haved succesfuly launched 2 solid rockets with apogees above 11,000 ft, and successfuly perfomred 2 static fires of our methalox engine designed for an apogee of 45,000 ft. 
                                 <br><br>
                                 During my time on the team, I've utilized my engineering skills for objectives such designing our main valve assembly for propellant feed, and manufacturing the conmposite airframes for our solid rocket projects. Through my time on the team, I have become a person who loves being able to get hands-on experience with hardware and enjoys solving challenging issues. 
                                 I've learned a great deal about the considerations that go into developing rockets including not just the standard factors such as cost, manufacturability, and mass but also in terms of safety, testing procedures/requirements, and the important yet dreadful process of documnentaion.
